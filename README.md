# Birds in Urban Blue Spaces
Annotated scripts and databases for reproducing blue space bird analysis. (Please set working directory to a folder with all this information). 

Order for the analysis is depicted in file names i.e. "1_rawcount_diversity_analysis" should be run first and then "2_species_freq_DPE" and so on... see
Bird_Analysis_List for more info. 

The main dataset is supplied as Master_DB_Birds, and other subsets created within scripts have also been uploaded; these will be reproduced when the code is run. Some plots will save directly into the directory. 

Markdown chunks are titled to assist in navigating around the script. Annotations are included but are not exhaustive.
