# Birds_Blue_Spaces
Annotated scripts and databases for reproducing blue space bird analysis. 

Order for the analysis is depicted in file names i.e. "1_rawcount_diversity_analysis" should be run first and then "2_species_freq_DPE" and so on...

Markdown chunks are titled to assist in navigating around the script. Annotations are included but are not exhaustive.
